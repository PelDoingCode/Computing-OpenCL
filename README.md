## Computing-OpenCL
### High Performance Computing

I have done for my studies a project on Open CL, here is the code and a detailled repport of my work that study time complexity of my different programs.

It a project of IMAGE PROCESSING WITH OPEN CL a powerful software to work efficiently on images.

   The aim was to code a Mean Filter by Convolution and a Gaussian Filter by Convolution ! 
  
   The main interesting aspect is that we had to optimize our code in order to be as fast as possible ! Because the final mark will take into account the speed up strategy and gain as well as the validity of the result !
  
  I got an improvment of 25% in time execution thanks to advance technique.
